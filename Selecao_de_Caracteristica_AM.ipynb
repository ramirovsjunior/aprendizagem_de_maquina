        "# 1.0 Feature Selection For Machine Learning\n",
        "## 1.1 Introduction\n",
        "Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in many cases, to improve the performance of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection techniques may generally grouped into those that use the target variable (supervised) and those that do not (unsupervised). In the unsupervised feature techniques, the removal of redundant variables occur using correlation or features that have few values or low variance. Additionally, the supervised techniques can be further divided into models that automatically select features as part of fitting the model (intrinsic), those that explicitly choose features that result in the best performing model (wrapper) and those that score each input feature and allow a subset to be selected (fillter).\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical-based feature selection methods involve evaluating the relationship between each input variable and the target variable using statistics and selecting those input variables that have the strongest relationship with the target variable. These methods can be fast and effective, although the choice of statistical measures depends on the data type of both the input and output variables. As such, it can be challenging for a machine learning practitioner to select an appropriate statistical measure for a dataset when performing filter-based feature selection\n",
        "\n",
        "When a mixture of input variable data types is present, different filter methods can be used. Alternately, a wrapper method such as the popular Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method can be used that is agnostic to the input variable type although they can be computationally expensive. Wrapper feature selection methods create many models with dierent subsets of input features and select those features that result in the best performing model according to a performance metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, you will discover how to choose feature selection methods with numerical and categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2 Statistics for feature selection (univariate selection)\n",
        "It is common to use correlation type statistical measures between input and output variables as the basis for filter feature selection. As such, the choice of statistical measures is highly dependent upon the variable data types. Common data types include numerical (such as age) and categorical (such as a workclass), although each may be further subdivided such as integer and floating point for numerical variables, and boolean, ordinal, or nominal for categorical variables. Input variables are those that are provided as input to a model. In feature selection, it is this group of variables that we wish to reduce in size. Output variables are those for which a model is intended to predict, often called the response variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The type of response variable typically indicates the type of predictive modeling problem being performed. For example, a numerical output variable indicates a regression predictive modeling problem, and a categorical output variable indicates a classifcation predictive modeling problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The statistical measures used in filter-based feature selection are generally calculated one input variable at a time with the target variable. As such, they are referred to as univariate statistical measures. This may mean that any interaction between input variables is not considered in the filtering process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of these techniques are univariate, meaning that they evaluate each predictor in isolation. In this case, the existence of correlated predictors makes it possible to select important, but redundant, predictors. The obvious consequences of this issue are that too many predictors are chosen and, as a result, collinearity problems arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can consider a tree of input and output variable types and select statistical measures of relationship or correlation designed to work with these data types. The figure below summarizes this tree and some commonly suggested statistics to use at the leaves of the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "Numerical input, numerical output\n",
        "The most common techniques are to use a correlation coefficient, such as Pearson's for a linear correlation, rank-based methods for a nonlinear correlation (Spearman) or mutual information. In fact, mutual information is a powerful method that may prove useful for both categorical and numerical data.\n",
        "Numerical input, categorical output\n",
        "This is a classification predictive modeling problem with numerical input variables. This might be the most common example of a classification problem. Again, the most common techniques are correlation based: linear (ANOVA), nonlinear (Kendall) and mutual information.\n",
        "Categorical input, numerical output\n",
        "This is a regression predictive modeling problem with categorical input variables. This is a strange example of a regression problem (e.g. you would not encounter it often). Nevertheless, you can use the same numerical input, categorical output methods (described above), but in reverse.\n",
        "Categorical input, categorical output\n",
        "This is a classification predictive modeling problem with categorical input variables. The most common correlation measure for categorical data is the chi-squared test. You can also use mutual information (information gain) from the field of information theory.\n",
        "## 1.3 Feature selection with any data type\n",
        "So far we have looked at measures of statistical correlation that are specific to numerical and categorical data types. It is rare that we have a dataset with just a single input variable data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "One approach to handling different input variable data types is to separately select numerical input variables and categorical input variables using appropriate metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another approach is to use a wrapper method that performs a search through different combinations or subsets of input features based on the effect they have on model quality. Simple methods might create a tree of all possible combinations of input features and navigate the graph based on the pay-off, e.g. using a best-first tree searching algorithm. Alternately, a stochastic global search algorithm can be used such as a genetic algorithm or simulated annealing. Although effective, these approaches can be computationally very expensive, specially for large training datasets and sophisticated models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simpler methods involve systematically adding or removing features from the model until no further improvement is seen. This includes so-called step-wise models (e.g. step-wise regression) and RFE. We will take a closer look at RFE later.\n",
        "\n",
        "A final data type agnostic method is to score input features using a model and use a filter-based feature selection method. Many models will automatically select features or score features as part of fitting the model and these scores can be used just like the statistical methods described above. Decision tree algorithms and ensembles of decision tree algorithms provide a input variable data type agnostic method of scoring input variables, including algorithms such as:\n",

        "## 1.4 Common questions\n",
        "### 1.4.1 How do you filter input variables?\n",
        "There are two main techniques for filltering input variables. The first is to rank all input variables by their score and select the k-top input variables with the largest score. The second approach is to convert the scores into a percentage of the largest score and select all features above a minimum percentile. Both of these approaches are available in the scikit-learn library:\n",
        "\n",
        "Select the top k variables: SelectKBest.\n",
        "Select the top percentile variables: SelectPercentile.\n",
        "### 1.4.2 How can I use statistics for other data types?\n",
        "Consider transforming the variables in order to access different statistical methods. For example, you can transform a categorical variable to ordinal, even if it is not, and see if any interesting results come out. You can also make a numerical variable discrete to try categorical-based measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some statistical measures assume properties of the variables, such as Pearson's correlation that assumes a Gaussian probability distribution to the observations and a linear relationship. You can transform the data to meet the expectations of the test and try the test regardless of the expectations and compare results.\n",
        "\n",
        "###1.4.3 How do I know what features were selected?\n",
        "You can apply a feature selection method as part of the modeling pipeline and the features that are selected may be hidden from you. If you want to know what features were selected by a given feature selection method, you can apply the feature selection method directly to your entire training dataset and report the column indexes of the selected features. You can then relate the column indexes to the names of your input variables to aide in interpreting your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "###1.4.4 What is the best feature selection method?\n",
        "This is unknowable. Just like there is no best machine learning algorithm, there is no best feature selection technique. At least not universally. Instead, you must discover what works best for your specific problem using careful systematic experimentation. Try a range of different techniques and discover what works best for your specific problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2.0 Hypothesis Testing: Fundamentals\n",
        "##2.1 Significance Testing\n",
        "###2.1.1 Hypothesis Testing\n",
        "In this section, we'll learn about hypothesis testing and statistical significance. A hypothesis is a pattern or rule about a process in the world that can be tested. We use hypothesis testing to determine if a change we made had a meaningful impact or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use hypothesis testing to help you determine:\n",
        "if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement,\n",
        "if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales,\n",
        "if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight.\n",
        "Observing a decrease in user engagement or sales after instituting a change doesn't automatically imply that the change was the cause. Hypothesis testing allows us to calculate the probability that random chance was actually responsible for the difference in outcome. Every process has some inherent amount of randomness that we can't measure and understanding the role of chance helps us reach a conclusion that's more likely to be correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "We first set up a null hypothesis that describes the status quo. We then state an alternative hypothesis, which we used to compare with the null hypothesis to decide which describes the data better. In the end, we either need to:\n",
        "\n",
        "reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis or\n",
        "accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis.\n",
        "We can frame each of the studies above as these rival pairs of hypotheses:\n",
        "\n",
        "if a new banner ad on a website caused a meaningful drop in the user engagement:\n",
        "null hypothesis: users who were exposed to the banner ad spent the same amount of time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
        "alternative hypothesis: users who were exposed to the banner ad spent less time on the website than those who weren't.\n",
        "if raising the price of a product caused a meaningful drop in sales:\n",
        "null hypothesis: the number of purchases of the product was the same at the lower price than it was at the higher price.\n",
        "alternative hypothesis: the number of purchases of the product was lower at the higher price than it was at the lower price.\n",
        "if a new weight loss pill helped people lose more weight:\n",
        "null hypothesis: patients who went on the weight loss pill lost no more weight than those who didn't.\n",
        "alternative hypothesis: patients who went on the weight loss pill lost more weight than those who didn't.\n",
        "In the rest of Section Significance Testing, we'll focus on the third scenario and use data to determine if a weight loss pill helped people lose weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.1.2 Research design\n",
        "To help us determine if the weight loss pill was effective, we conducted a study where we invited 100 volunteers and split them into 2 even groups randomly:\n",
        "\n",
        "Group A was given a placebo, or fake, pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
        "Group B was given the actual weight loss pill and instructed to consume it on a daily basis.\n",
        "Both groups were instructed to change nothing else about their diets. Group A is referred to as the control group while group B is referred to as the treatment group. This type of study is called a blind experiment since the participants didn't know which pill they were receiving. This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the research design for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of your analysis. It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper. The weight loss pill study we conducted is known as an experimental study. Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2.1.3 Statistical significance\n",
        "Statistics helps us determine if the difference in the weight lost between the 2 groups (A and B) is because of random chance or because of an actual difference in the outcomes. If there is a meaningful difference, we say that the results are statistically significant. We'll dive into what this means exactly over the course of this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we're familiar with the study, let's state our null and alternative hypotheses more precisely. Our null hypothesis should describe the default position of skepticism, which is that there's no statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups. Put another way, it should state that any difference is due to random chance. Our alternative hypothesis should state that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between the outcomes of the 2 groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Null hypothesis: participants who consumed the weight loss pills lost the same amount of weight as those who didn't take the pill.\n",
        "Alternative hypothesis: participants who consumed the weight loss pills lost more weight than those who didn't take the pill."

        "\n",
        "The permutation test is a statistical test that involves simulating rerunning the study many times and recalculating the test statistic for each iteration. The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the sampling distribution and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, than the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we accept the alternative hypothesis instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "To simulate rerunning the study, we randomly reassign each data point (weight lost) to either group A or group B. We keep track of the recalculated test statistics as a separate list. By re-randomizing the groups that the weight loss values belong to, we're simulating what randomly generated groupings of these weight loss values would look like. We then use these randomly generated groupings to understand how rare the groupings in our actual data were.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, the number of times we re-randomize the groups that each data point belongs to matches the total number of possible permutations. Usually, the number of total permutations is too high for even powerful supercomputers to calculate within a reasonable time frame. While we'll use 1000 iterations for now since we'll get the results back quickly, in later we'll learn how to quantify the tradeoff we make between accuracy and speed to determine the optimal number of iterations.\n",
